    <h3>What is CSS grid?</h3>
    <p>Before I go into detail about my project, it’s best to have a better understanding of what CSS grid is. 
        “CSS grid is a layout method designed for the two-dimensional layout of items on a web page or application.”
        (GridByExample, unknown). This basically means that it makes it easier to design web pages without having to use 
        floats and positioning.</p>

    

    <h3>Current browser support</h3>
    <p>CSS Grid is currently supported by the majority of updated browsers such as Chrome and 
        Firefox. However internet explorer still doesn't fully support grid yet. 
        See <a class="highlight" href="https://caniuse.com/">Can I Use</a> to see if the browser you are 
        using supports the grid layout.</p>


    <img class="blog-content-image" src="../images/blog/grid-browsers.png" alt="Grid support on different browsers">


    <h3>My current skill</h3>
    <p>Before starting this project I had never used CSS grid before as I was set in my ways of using other technologies, 
        such as flexbox, for my layouts. I convinced myself that there was no need of learning another technique for laying 
        out websites. But once I found out what you could do with CSS grid, I knew I had to try it.</p>


    <h3>The project</h3>
    <p>Before starting the second project I had to find a suitable complex layout that would be hard to replicate on the 
        web. I searched several magazine archives online, but I struggled finding a design that didn't heavily rely on 
        using images and a column layout. </p>
    
    <p>After searching for a while I finally found an <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/02/creating-visual-hierarchies-typography/" class="highlight">article on smashing magazine</a> 
        which talked about unusual visual hierarchies.</p>
    
    <p>In this article I found the perfect layout that I wanted to replicate. The design was of an advertisement for a 
        Frankenstein theatre performance. It includes a variety of text and sizes all laid out in a non-linear fashion.</p>

    <p><em>Note: For this project I used the firefox developer edition which gave me a visual representation of the 
        grid on the page.</em></p>




<h3>The approach</h3>
<p>As with every project, I started with a mobile first approach in mind, designed for the smallest screen 
    and working my way up. It is the ideology that mobile design, as the hardest, should be done first. 
    This is because the smallest designs will only have essential features. The key to mobile first is 
    to make sure there is a good hierarchy of information meaning that all the important information 
    can be found at the top of the page, such as the play name and dates.</p>

<p>First I created the mobile wireframes created in Adobe XD. This design includes a 2 column grid with
     each block of text is separated with a quote from the play.</p>
     <img class="blog-content-image-wireframe" src="../images/blog/test-image.jpg" alt="6 column wireframe created in Adobe XD">





<p>Then I created a wireframe for the desktop version of the site using the image I was replicating. 
    This was useful as it allowed me to see at a glance how many rows and columns I will need (6 columns and 4 rows).</p>

<h3>The coding</h3>

<!-- codepen -->
<p class="codepen" data-height="333" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="NotLewis" data-slug-hash="BbEoMw" style="height: 333px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Project 1 - part 1">
        <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/NotLewis/pen/BbEoMw/">
        Project 1 - part 1</a> by Lewis Hall (<a href="https://codepen.io/NotLewis">@NotLewis</a>)
        on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
      </p>
      <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


<p>To see the grid in action let's take a look at my project. I started of by converting all of the text from 
    the original image into HTML. With a little bit of styling in CSS, the page is starting to look similar to 
    what I designed in Adobe XD.</p>


    <!-- codepen -->
<p class="codepen" data-height="263" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="css" data-user="NotLewis" data-slug-hash="pYBgZM" style="height: 263px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="part2">
        <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/NotLewis/pen/pYBgZM/">
        part2</a> by Lewis Hall (<a href="https://codepen.io/NotLewis">@NotLewis</a>)
        on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
      </p>
      <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<p>Next I enclosed all of the divs containing content within another div named <code>grid-container</code>. This enabled 
    me to start adding a grid to the webpage. I started of with creating the 2 column grid by using the 
</code>display: grid</code> is required to start using the grid layout and the fr unit makes sure that the 
values will be divided equally.</p>




<h3>Mobile view</h3>
<!-- codepen -->
<p class="codepen" data-height="356" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="css" data-user="NotLewis" data-slug-hash="GeLoRE" style="height: 356px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="part3">
        <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/NotLewis/pen/GeLoRE/">
        part3</a> by Lewis Hall (<a href="https://codepen.io/NotLewis">@NotLewis</a>)
        on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
      </p>
      <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


<p>Once I had two columns I could then start moving elements around the page. This is done by specifying which 
    column and row a div will fall into. For example, the main quote, which is on row 3, starts on column one 
    and spans over to the third column.</p>

<img class="blog-content-image-small" src="../images/blog/grid-2column.png" alt="example of 2 column grid layout">
<p>The layout should now look close to what I had originally designed in my mobile wireframe.</p>





<h3>Tablet view</h3>
<img class="blog-content-image-small" src="../images/blog/grid-3column.png" alt="example of 3 column grid layout">

<p>Once the browser reaches 740 px in width. The grid then changes from a 2 column to a 3 column grid using media 
    queries. This enables me to play around with the layout a lot more. At this point my design is starting to look 
    more similar to the original one, with the title at the top of the page and the main quote in the middle being 
    surrounded by text. As the page width increases, so does the size of the text.</p>

<p>This was achieved in a similar way as the two column grid, but this time <code>grid-template-columns</code> is set to <code>repeat(3,1fr)</code>. 
    This line of code is a simple and more semantical way of setting three columns with an equal width. </p>





  <h3>Desktop view</h3>
  <!-- codepen -->
  <p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="css" data-user="NotLewis" data-slug-hash="vPMLzp" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid black; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="part4">
          <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/NotLewis/pen/vPMLzp/">
          part4</a> by Lewis Hall (<a href="https://codepen.io/NotLewis">@NotLewis</a>)
          on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
        </p>
        <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

  <p>Finally once the viewport reaches 1340px the screen size is big enough to where I can replicate the original design. This was done by 
      setting up a six column grid, with the fourth column being twice the size as the others. 
      <code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 2fr 1fr 1fr;</code></p>

  <p>Then using the same technique of moving the each element around using <code>grid-column</code> and 
  <code>grid-row</code> I was able to replicated the original design.</p>


    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>Learning CSS grid taught me a lot about layouts on the web. One problem I encountered was that in the original design, 
        the quote inside the grey container was up a little bit outside of the grid. To overcome this I simply added 
        <code>position: relative</code> and <code>top: -5rem</code> to move the element up. 
        Position relative was something that I had hardly used in the past and its another layout technique I understand more than before.</p>
