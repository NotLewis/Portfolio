<p> As you can probably tell, my portfolio has undergone several changes since my last blog post. 
    These changes come in all different shapes and sizes, from a quick redesign to performance improvements. This blog will outline what changes I made and why.</p>


<a href="https://16021537.webdevmmu.uk/OLD/a.old_PortfolioArchieve/index.html" class="highlight">Link to my archieved portfolio</a>

<h3>The little things</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In my original portfolio I tended to overwrite my alt text. With this improved version I made sure to use around 5 or less words.</li>
    <li>In order to improve the site load speed I used the method of minifying my CSS which “dramatically improves site speed and accessibility”. My CSS file went from around 16kb to 10kb, 
      which may not seem a lot in terms of file size, but in terms of the amount of code it has been significantly reduced.</li>
    <li>I also resized lots of my images to not only decrease the file size but to also make sure that each image size on the blog section were consistent with one another.</li>
    <li>Every button tag previously used are now gone, replaced with an anchor tag which is styled to look and act like a button.</li>
    <li>My file structure has also undergone a makeover. All my file names are now in lower case and each image has been moved to their respective folder.</li>
    <li>As you have probably noticed, there has been a change in the colour scheme. This is because I felt that the green was to 'in your face' and very distracting. I didnt want people visiting my site
       to have their focus shifted from the content. Therefore, I changed the colour to a deep blue to better match the SVG on the homepage.</li>
</ul>
        
              
 <h3>Redesign</h3>      
        
<p>With feedback from my tutors and the portfolio show I felt that I needed to change how I used headings to break up sections of my portfolio.    
    In my original design I had my headings for each section on the left hand side of the screen which created inconsistency with the rest of the site. 
    This was especially noticeable in my about section where the heading was so far away from the rest of the text. 
</p>    
       
        
 <p>In order to change this I simply moved the headings to the center of the page, increasing the size, altering the colour to match my new colour scheme 
    and by adding more padding to the top and bottom. I also altered the heading text to be more semantic, rather than using “What I have been up to” which can be 
    interpreted in different ways.This was a simple but effective way to make my portfolio look less cluttered and confusing.
</p>       
        
    

<p>Another change can be seen in my recent projects. I felt a complete overall on how this section was presented was needed because the original looked too 
    'blocky' and out of place with the rest of my portfolio.</p>



<p>With my updated version I am able to fit more information about each project without having to leave to another page. This also got rid of the massive border 
    shadow around each project. <em>Don’t ask me why I thought this was a good idea!</em> This was done by using floats in order to get move the text next to the image.

   Another bonus is that I don’t have to constantly update my portfolio with each new project because the user can now see all of my projects 
    simply by going to my github page</p>

<p>The contact section has also undergone some minor changes such as making the width a lot smaller as the original felt a bit too wide.</p>

<p>And you will be happy to know, more padding has been added between each section so that they don't look too squished together.</p>
        


  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>And that's what I have been up to these past few months on my portfolio. If you have any question or feedback, please don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
